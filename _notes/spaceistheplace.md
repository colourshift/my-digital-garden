<p>It was late autumn 1996 and Beat had just come out.  Mikey, he & I were still tight and we drove to [[Austin]] in his pickup for record binges at all the best [[music]] shops. I was Pavement &amp; Olivia Tremor Control, he was GBV &amp; Flaming Lips, but you never knew what you'd turn up at Waterloo et al.</p>

<p>We stayed at Janie’s house that weekend, and she was modeling at the time. She’d just come back from Milan or somewhere to that general glamorous effect.  Just post-sunset, we all headed to the original Whole Foods on Guadalupe for dinner fixins’.  I wasn't used to produce but there we stood, evaluating fluorescent-lit green scallions and blazing red pomegranates.</p>

<p>It was still mild out, as autumn air in central [[Texas]] can be, like summer bathwater that’s been left to cool just a shade too long.  Janie wore a tiny white t-shirt and lime green hot shorts plus platform sandals, and I remember covertly staring at her insanely long shiny legs in front of the brightly-lit veggies and thinking how does that just happen? Her legs were unreal. Like gently bending boughs carved out of oiled porcelain. A seeming blessing.</p>

<p>Later, back at the house, __Beat__ had just ended. The three of us sat down for dinner as I put Sun Ra’s __Space Is the Place__ on the CD player; she twirled her fork around her linguini, cocked her head, and asked “what is this?!” incredulously.  “Sun Ra,” I answered, and she said she liked it. I felt pleased, like somehow her beauty rendered her sensibilities superior to mine or Mike’s or really anyone else’s on the planet. Such is the power of female beauty, even for females adjacent.</p>

<p>She moved to New York soon after this, and I remember Carrie ran into her at some Lower East Side dive somewhere, summer of ’98.  She relayed to me how lonely Janie said she was in the city, and how hard it had always been for her to make girlfriends.  Because they were always suspicious of her, especially around boys, like just looking the way she looked she’d have been able to suck up the whole of the hetero male populus with the slightest sweet inhale of her very elongated breath.  I thought back to Bowery Electric and that night two years previous in the supermarket and nodded. Her legs and then her eyes, even then, how they had a certain clarity, like the ring of a bell, sounding with just the slightest timbre of sadness.</p>

<p>Isn’t that funny, I finally remarked to C, how the girls and boys who have the most sometimes seem the most lost with it?</p>
